defines a GOOM policy where Graphics RAM is released. The order below is the order in which the OOM Monitor releases RAM. 
Work on the GOOM Moitor config file will be based on this.

Aim of GOOM:
Run ALF plugin
Call on Policy Server of MM to free G Ram

	The max_app_close_batch indicates how many applications can be closed in parallel.

	default_wait_after_plugin defines how long is waited (in milliseconds) after
