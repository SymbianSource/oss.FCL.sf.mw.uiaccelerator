History:
- first version 13.5.2008:


A) Problems:
---------

1 when layout change happens, screen is not redrawn. Redraw happens when plate area is tapped 
  or screen saver is removed by tapping (by tapping number display, screen is not redrawn. 
  Adding pointer observer seems to cause redraw event). 
  HUI guys were asked for help. I sent also codes. They could not see the problem. 
  This occurred on 8.5-9.5. Probably no further investigation has been done to solve this. 


B) Further development plans/ideas:
-----------------------------------

1) numbers should be graphic images that similar numbers as plate number have would be used. 
  Graphics designer knows this. 
2) if graphics number are not used, scaling number during layout change...
3) many other things with number display e.g. borders, their shadow (actually there were borders 
   and border shadow in the past - this was a task of one earlier sprint. They were somehow lost).
4) plan is to use curve path to make numbers 'fly' from plate to number display. 
  Tero Viitala-Kiss had one prototype of this. Could it be possible even to use random path
  for fly route!?
5) physical feedback about rotating plate. There is class CAlfExAnalogDialerFeedback for that. 
   I don't know how suitable its API is for current use. It worked in one prototype but does not work anymore. 
   
   I used tactile feedback API. Feedback of tactile feedback was too mild. Vibra API could suite better.
  
   Vibra could used in two occasions
   - when number is being dialed, after delta of Xth degrees (denoting that dialled number changes,
     if stylus were lifted up)
   - when plate rotates back to idle position
6) usage of layout data. Usage would mainly focused on display number characteristics.
